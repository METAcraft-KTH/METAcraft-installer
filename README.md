# METAcraft-installer
An Installer that installs Fabric and Simple Voice Chat that allows player to play with proximity chat on METAcraft.

Fork of [FabricMC/fabric-installer](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-installer).

## How to update / change Minecraft and mod versions
Go to the file `installer.properties` and at the top, change the values for the Minecraft version and Fabric loader version.

Also go to Modrinth and find the new versions of Simple Voice Chat and Sodium. Find the Download button for the version, right click and copy link. Use that link as the download link.

To skip a mod (for example if Sodium hasn't updated yet) then just leave it empty.
